Welcome to the Harley2048 app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Wrichik Basu. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All this app is, is a viewer of this website: https://harley2048-6f19c.web.app/ it is a simple javascript application, which means no data leaves your device.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Colin Wilson.
